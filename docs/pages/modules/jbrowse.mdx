## Genome browser

The JBrowse module in our application provides an interactive genome browser, 
integrating various genomic data sources for detailed analysis and visualization. 

### Integrated Data Sources

#### 1. Gene Models
The gene models are sourced from Plant Ensembl genomes, providing comprehensive annotation of gene structures, including exons, introns, and untranslated regions (UTRs).

#### 2. Variant Tracks
Variant tracks for 54 accessions of Camelina plants are integrated into JBrowse, allowing users to explore genetic variation across different cultivars.

#### 3. RNAseq Data
RNAseq data for 135 accessions are available, enabling the visualization of gene expression levels across various tissues and conditions.

### Accessions Overview

The JBrowse module includes data for the following accessions:

| Cultivar  | Number of Accessions |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Celine    | 1                    |
| CO-46     | 6                    |
| DH55      | 55                   |
| Joelle    | 6                    |
| Suneson   | 39                   |
| NA        | 28                   |

### Tissue Samples Overview

The RNAseq data includes samples from 12 different tissues, providing a comprehensive view of gene expression across various parts of the plant:

| Tissue          | Number of Samples |

| Senescing leaf  | 3                 |
| Shoot           | 8                 |
| Stem            | 4                 |
| Youngleaf       | 3                 |
| NA              | 10                |

### Usage

The JBrowse module allows users to:

- **Navigate the Genome**: Browse through the genomic regions, zoom in/out, and explore gene models and variant locations.
- **Visualize Variants**: Examine genetic variants across different accessions, compare their positions, and study their potential effects on gene function.
- **Explore Gene Expression**: View RNAseq data across multiple tissues, analyze expression patterns, and identify differentially expressed genes.

Below are some example images demonstrating the capabilities of the JBrowse module:
